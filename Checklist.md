For anyone who submitted the first Greenfoot project proposal, all of your works have not been approved.
I would like to guide you how to edit your proposal.
1. Background: For this part, we need to know your overall idea about your game. For example, what type of your game (Puzzle, Shooting, RPG, etc), or if your game has many states or many levels, you should tell us about it. Telling us how to play your game is very important in a proposal. Explanation about how to play the game also includes how to get the score, and how to end the game. Additional information, such as your inspiration or your game story, we are also glad to read.
2. Expected benefits: For this part, you should tell us what benefits you expect the player will get from playing your game. For example, if your game is a puzzle game, your player will get logical thinking or if your game is a vocabulary game, your player will get new vocabularies. If your game is only for fun, you should identify more about fun, such as excited, motivated, relaxed, etc.
3. Scope of work: For this part, you have to list which features you are going to do in each week. Also, you have to identify who will be responsible for each one. For example, week no.1 Mr.A will implement the movement of all character, Mr.B will implement the movement of the screen, and Mr.C will implement the function to count the score. Please ensure your plan is suitable in terms of time management. We do not need you do it all just one week before the submission.
Please follow these guidelines, edit your proposal, and submit it again.
